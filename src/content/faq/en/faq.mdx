            <blockquote>
                Currently there isn't a way to edit a published post. The
                easiest way to fix or change a post is to copy the content into
                a new post and delete the old post.

          <summary>Why do I need to select a tax code?</summary>
          <blockquote>
            Stripe requires that all items have a tax category assigned so that sales tax can be properly calculated. As stated in the Terms, LearnGrove only calculates, collects, and remits sales tax in states where we have a Marketplace Collection Agreement, however every item listed still needs an appropriate tax category. It is your responsibility as the listing creator to select the most appropriate category for your resource. For specific guidance, we always recommend speaking with a tax professional.
