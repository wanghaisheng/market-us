After you submit your notice, if it contains all of the information, we will consider the request and take appropriate action in good faith. The more specific your claim as to where your trademarked or copyrighted content appears on our website the better we are able to address your claim.

The User against whom you make a claim has the right to make a Counter-Notice if they believe that you misidentified their content as infringement.
